# 99_botles-of-beer-OOP
	Write an application using an int and String variable, a while loop and two if tests to output the following song to the screen:								
99 bottles of beer on the wall
	99 bottles of beer 
	Take one down
	Pass it around
(Line space)
	98 bottles of beer on the wall
(Line Space)

Note: 	the above screen is to be repeated until you reach 0
However when you reach 1 it is only 1 bottle ….
	The final line is “No more bottles of beer on the wall”	

	When you have the program working as above, alter it to deal with any number of bottles where the number is entered from the keyboard.
